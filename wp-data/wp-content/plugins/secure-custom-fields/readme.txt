Secure Custom Fields boosts content management with custom fields and options. It deactivates Advanced Custom Fields to prevent duplicate code errors.

== Description ==

Secure Custom Fields (SCF) extends WordPress’s capabilities, transforming it into a flexible content management tool. With SCF, managing custom data becomes straightforward and efficient.

**Easily create fields on demand.**
The SCF builder makes it easy to add fields to WordPress edit screens, whether you’re adding a new “ingredients” field to a recipe or designing complex metadata for a specialized site.

**Flexibility in placement.**
Fields can be applied throughout WordPress—posts, pages, users, taxonomy terms, media, comments, and even custom options pages—organizing your data how you want.

**Display seamlessly.**
Using SCF functions, you can display custom field data in your templates, making content integration easy for all levels of developers.

**A comprehensive content management solution.**
Beyond custom fields, SCF allows you to register new post types and taxonomies directly from the SCF interface, providing more control without needing additional plugins or custom code.

**Accessible and user-friendly design.**
The field interface aligns with WordPress’s native design, creating an experience that’s both accessible and easy for content creators to use.

Installing this plugin will deactivate plugins with matching function names/functionality, specifically Advanced Custom Fields, Advanced Custom Fields Pro, and the legacy Secure Custom Fields plugins, to avoid code errors.
